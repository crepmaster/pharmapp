# PharmApp Mobile - Changes Log (2025-10-19)

## 🎯 **MAJOR UX IMPROVEMENT: Country Selection FIRST**

**Date**: October 19, 2025
**Status**: ✅ Code Complete, Ready for Testing
**Impact**: High - Fundamental change to registration flow

---

## 📋 **SUMMARY OF CHANGES**

### **Main Objective**
Redesigned pharmacy registration flow to ask for **country and payment method FIRST**, before collecting pharmacy details. This ensures:
- User knows their currency immediately (XAF, KES, NGN, etc.)
- Phone number format validation matches selected country
- Payment operators are contextually appropriate
- Pharmacies can be grouped by country/city for operations

### **User Flow Change**

**BEFORE (Old Flow):**
```
1. Fill ALL pharmacy details (name, email, phone, address, password)
2. Click "Continue"
3. Select country & payment method
4. Complete registration
```

**AFTER (New Flow - Country First):**
```
1. WELCOME SCREEN with "Select Country & Payment Method" button
2. Choose country (🇨🇲 🇰🇪 🇹🇿 🇺🇬 🇳🇬)
3. Select payment operator (MTN, Orange, M-Pesa, etc.)
4. Enter mobile money number
5. THEN fill pharmacy details (name, email, address, password)
6. Complete registration
```

---

## 🔧 **FILES MODIFIED**

### **1. pharmacy_app/lib/screens/auth/register_screen.dart**

**Changes Made:**
- Added `_currentStep` variable to track registration steps (0 = country, 1 = pharmacy details)
- Created `_buildCountrySelectionPrompt()` widget showing welcome screen
- Modified `build()` method to conditionally show step 0 or step 1
- Renamed `_navigateToPaymentMethod()` to `_showCountrySelection()`
- Updated button text from "Continue" to "Complete Registration"
- Added informational card explaining why country selection comes first

**Key Code Additions:**
```dart
// Line 33: Step tracking
int _currentStep = 0; // 0 = Country/Payment Selection, 1 = Pharmacy Details

// Line 68-90: Country selection navigation
void _showCountrySelection() async {
  final result = await Navigator.of(context).push<PaymentPreferences>(
    MaterialPageRoute(
      builder: (context) => CountryPaymentSelectionScreen(
        title: 'Step 1: Select Your Country & Payment',
        subtitle: 'This determines your currency, phone format, and payment operators',
        allowSkip: false, // MUST select country first!
        ...
      ),
    ),
  );

  if (result != null) {
    setState(() {
      _paymentPreferences = result;
      _currentStep = 1; // Move to pharmacy details form
    });
  }
}

// Line 164-166: Conditional UI based on step
if (_currentStep == 0) {
  return _buildCountrySelectionPrompt();
}

// Line 479-608: New welcome screen widget
Widget _buildCountrySelectionPrompt() {
  // Beautiful welcome screen with:
  // - Logo
  // - "Welcome to PharmApp!" title
  // - Big button: "Select Country & Payment Method"
  // - Info card explaining benefits
}
```

**Lines Changed:** ~140 lines added/modified
**Total File Size:** 609 lines (was 468 lines)

### **2. pharmacy_app/lib/firebase_options.dart**

**Changes Made:**
- Updated web API key from placeholder to real Firebase key (TEMPORARY for testing)
- Updated web App ID from placeholder to real Firebase App ID
- Added comment noting keys are temporary and will be reverted before commit

**Key Changes:**
```dart
// Line 26-30: Real keys for testing
static const FirebaseOptions web = FirebaseOptions(
  // TEMPORARY: Real keys for TESTING ONLY - will revert before commit
  apiKey: String.fromEnvironment('FIREBASE_WEB_API_KEY',
         defaultValue: 'AIzaSyDrM96tzLwGkVaCvqEP9cWAXZYqvOEGyAs'), // ← REAL KEY
  appId: String.fromEnvironment('FIREBASE_WEB_APP_ID',
         defaultValue: '1:850077575356:web:67c7130629f17dd57708b9'), // ← REAL APP ID
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** These keys are TEMPORARY for testing. They should be:
- Kept in local development only
- Never pushed to public git repository
- Protected by .gitignore or reverted before commit

**Lines Changed:** 2 lines modified

5. Click "Register" or "Create Account"

**Expected Result:**
```
✅ PASS if screen shows:
- "Welcome to PharmApp!" title
- Big button: "Select Country & Payment Method"
- Info card explaining why country comes first:
  • Sets your currency (XAF, KES, NGN, etc.)
  • Shows correct phone format
  • Displays available payment operators
  • Helps group pharmacies by city/region
- NO pharmacy detail form fields (name, email, password, etc.)

❌ FAIL if screen shows:
- Pharmacy Name field
- Email field
- Any form input fields
- "Continue" button at bottom of form
```

**Proof Required:**
- Screenshot of registration screen

```

**Proof Required:**
- Firebase Authentication screenshot showing new user
- Firestore screenshot showing pharmacy document with payment preferences
- Firestore screenshot showing wallet document

## 🔒 **SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS**

### **Firebase API Keys**

**Current State:**
- ✅ Real API keys added to `firebase_options.dart` for testing
- ⚠️ Keys are in plain text in file
- ⚠️ File is tracked by git

**Before Public Commit:**
```bash
# Option 1: Revert to placeholders
git checkout pharmacy_app/lib/firebase_options.dart

# Option 2: Add to .gitignore
echo "pharmacy_app/lib/firebase_options.dart" >> .gitignore

# Option 3: Use environment variables only
# Remove defaultValue from firebase_options.dart
# Pass keys via: flutter run --dart-define=FIREBASE_WEB_API_KEY=...
```

### **.gitignore Verification**

Check that sensitive files are ignored:
```bash
# Verify .gitignore includes:
**/firebase_options.dart     # Firebase configuration
**/google-services.json      # Android Firebase config
**/GoogleService-Info.plist  # iOS Firebase config
**/.env                       # Environment variables
**/secrets.json              # Any secrets file
```

## 📊 **MIGRATION IMPACT**

### **Breaking Changes**
- ❌ **NONE** - This is a UI-only change

### **Backward Compatibility**
- ✅ Backend API unchanged
- ✅ Data models unchanged (PaymentPreferences already has country/operator fields)
- ✅ Existing user accounts unaffected
- ✅ Existing registrations still work

### **Database Schema**
- ✅ No schema changes required
- ✅ PaymentPreferences model already supports country/operator fields (added 2025-10-18)

## ⚠️ **KNOWN ISSUES & WORKAROUNDS**

### **Issue 1: Multiple Background Processes**
**Problem:** Many background flutter run processes competing for port 8084
**Impact:** Cannot guarantee which code version is running
**Workaround:** Kill all processes, restart computer, launch ONE fresh instance
**Permanent Fix:** Use port management or Docker containers

### **Issue 2: Hot Reload May Not Apply Changes**
**Problem:** Major structural changes (new widgets) don't always hot-reload
**Impact:** Old code may still be running despite hot reload
**Workaround:** Full restart required (flutter run, not hot reload)
**Permanent Fix:** Always do full restart for major UI changes

### **Issue 3: Firebase Keys in Code**
**Problem:** Real Firebase keys temporarily in firebase_options.dart
**Impact:** Risk of credential exposure if committed
**Workaround:** Revert before commit OR add to .gitignore
**Permanent Fix:** Use environment variables exclusively
