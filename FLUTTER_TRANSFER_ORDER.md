## Overview
This document provides the exact order of operations for transferring your Flutter multi-app development environment (PharmApp Mobile) from one laptop to another using the specialized Flutter transfer agents.

---

## ðŸ“‹ PHASE 1: PREPARATION (OLD LAPTOP)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active internet connection
- [ ] Git repository access
- [ ] VS Code with Claude Code extension running
- [ ] PharmApp Mobile project is open and all three apps are working
- [ ] Firebase project `mediexchange` is accessible

### Step 1: Pre-Transfer Verification
```bash
# Check Flutter environment
flutter doctor -v
flutter --version
dart --version

# Check project structure
ls -la  # Should see: pharmacy_app/, courier_app/, admin_panel/, shared/

# Verify all apps build
cd pharmacy_app && flutter build apk --debug && cd ..
cd courier_app && flutter build apk --debug && cd ..
cd admin_panel && flutter build web && cd ..

# Check Git status
git status
git branch -a
```

### Step 2: Launch Flutter Backup Agent
1. **Open Claude Code** in your PharmApp Mobile project
2. **Use this exact prompt**:
   ```
   Launch the Flutter Backup Agent to prepare this multi-app Flutter project for transfer. Document the complete Flutter development environment, all three apps (Pharmacy, Courier, Admin Panel), Firebase configuration, and shared packages.
   ```

### Step 3: Agent Execution
The Flutter backup agent will automatically:
- [ ] Document Flutter SDK and Dart versions
- [ ] Export VS Code Flutter/Dart extensions
- [ ] Backup pubspec.yaml for all three apps
- [ ] Document Firebase project configuration
- [ ] Snapshot shared package dependencies
- [ ] Document Android SDK and iOS tools (if macOS)
- [ ] Check Git status and ensure everything is committed
- [ ] Create comprehensive Flutter environment documentation

### Step 4: Verify Backup Files
Check that these files were created:
- [ ] `flutter-version-backup.txt`
- [ ] `pubspec-dependencies-backup.txt`
- [ ] `firebase-config-backup/` directory
- [ ] `platform-tools-backup.txt`
- [ ] `vscode-flutter-extensions.txt`
- [ ] `shared-packages-backup.txt`
- [ ] `FLUTTER_BACKUP_SUMMARY.txt`

### Step 5: Firebase Configuration Backup
```bash
# Document Firebase project details
firebase projects:list > firebase-projects.txt
firebase apps:list --project=mediexchange > firebase-apps.txt

# Note: Do NOT backup google-services.json (contains sensitive keys)
# These will be re-downloaded on new laptop
```

### Step 6: Commit and Push
```bash
# Add backup files to git
git add flutter-version-backup.txt
git add pubspec-dependencies-backup.txt
git add firebase-config-backup/
git add platform-tools-backup.txt
git add vscode-flutter-extensions.txt
git add shared-packages-backup.txt
git add FLUTTER_BACKUP_SUMMARY.txt

# Commit backup files
git commit -m "Add Flutter multi-app environment backup files for laptop transfer

- Complete Flutter/Dart environment documentation
- All three apps dependencies backed up (Pharmacy, Courier, Admin)
- Firebase project configuration documented
- VS Code extensions and settings exported
- Platform tools and shared packages documented"

# Push to remote repository
git push origin main
```

### Step 7: Final Verification
- [ ] All changes are committed and pushed
- [ ] Backup files are in the repository
- [ ] Firebase project is accessible
- [ ] You have repository clone URL ready
- [ ] Old laptop Flutter environment is documented

```bash
# Pharmacy App dependencies
cd pharmacy_app
flutter pub get
flutter pub upgrade
cd ..

# Courier App dependencies
cd courier_app
flutter pub get
flutter pub upgrade
cd ..

# Admin Panel dependencies
cd admin_panel
flutter pub get
flutter pub upgrade
cd ..

# Shared package dependencies
cd shared
flutter pub get
cd ..
```

### Step 5: Firebase Configuration
The agent will guide you through:
- [ ] Firebase CLI installation
- [ ] Firebase login: `firebase login`
- [ ] Project verification: `firebase projects:list`
- [ ] Download configuration files for each app
- [ ] Set up Firebase emulators (optional)

### Step 6: Platform-Specific Setup

# Test all three apps build successfully
echo "Testing Pharmacy App..."
cd pharmacy_app && flutter build apk --debug && cd ..

echo "Testing Courier App..."
cd courier_app && flutter build apk --debug && cd ..

echo "Testing Admin Panel..."
cd admin_panel && flutter build web && cd ..

# Run static analysis
cd pharmacy_app && flutter analyze && cd ..
cd courier_app && flutter analyze && cd ..
cd admin_panel && flutter analyze && cd ..
```

### Step 8: Development Environment Verification
```bash
# Check Flutter doctor status
flutter doctor -v

# Check available devices
