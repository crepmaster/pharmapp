# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a Flutter-based medicine exchange platform with two separate mobile applications that connect to a Firebase backend system:

- **pharmacy_app/**: Mobile app for pharmacies to manage inventory and exchange medicines
- **courier_app/**: Mobile app for couriers handling deliveries between pharmacies
- **shared/**: (Currently empty) Intended for shared code/utilities between apps

Both apps are built with Flutter 3.13+ and use Firebase as the backend service.

### Backend Integration

The mobile apps connect to a Firebase backend system (separate repository at D:\Projects\pharmapp) that provides:
- **Payment Processing**: Mobile money integration (MTN MoMo, Orange Money)
- **Exchange Management**: Peer-to-peer pharmaceutical exchanges with escrow functionality
- **Wallet System**: User balance management with hold/release mechanisms
- **Firebase Functions**: Cloud functions for payment webhooks, exchange workflows, and scheduled tasks
- **Firebase Project ID**: `mediexchange`

## Development Commands

### Building and Running
```bash
# Run pharmacy app
cd pharmacy_app && flutter run

# Run courier app  
cd courier_app && flutter run

# Build APK for pharmacy app
cd pharmacy_app && flutter build apk

# Build APK for courier app
cd courier_app && flutter build apk
```

### Testing and Analysis
```bash
# Run tests for pharmacy app
cd pharmacy_app && flutter test

# Run tests for courier app
cd courier_app && flutter test

# Analyze code for issues
cd pharmacy_app && flutter analyze
cd courier_app && flutter analyze

# Format code
cd pharmacy_app && dart format .
cd courier_app && dart format .
```

### Firebase
Firebase project ID: `mediexchange`
Both apps are configured with Firebase and include:
- Authentication
- Firestore database
- Cloud Functions
- Push notifications

### Backend System Architecture (D:\Projects\pharmapp)

**Firestore Collections:**
- `payments` - Payment intent records
- `webhook_logs` - Webhook call logs (TTL: 30 days)
- `wallets` - User wallet balances (available/held amounts)
- `ledger` - Transaction history
- `exchanges` - Exchange state (hold_active/completed/canceled)
- `idempotency` - Idempotency tracking

**Key Workflows:**
- Payment Flow: Create payment intent → External webhook → Credit wallet (idempotent)
- Exchange Flow: Create hold (50/50 courier fee split) → Capture/Cancel → Process transaction
- Security: Webhook authentication, Firestore rules, ACID transactions, idempotency

**Backend Commands:**
- `cd functions && npm run build` - Build TypeScript functions
- `cd functions && npm run serve` - Start Firebase emulator
- `cd functions && npm run deploy` - Deploy functions
- `cd functions && npm test` - Run 69 unit tests
- `pwsh ./scripts/test-cloudrun.ps1 -RunDemo` - Test full payment/exchange flow

## 🛠️ Previous Session Work (2025-08-31)

### ✅ **Completed:**
- ✅ **Custom Medicine Creation Feature**: Full workflow implemented
  - `CreateCustomMedicineScreen` with comprehensive form validation
  - Integration with existing `AddMedicineScreen` workflow
  - Firebase `medicines` collection saving with proper security rules
  - Automatic selection of newly created medicine for inventory
- ✅ **Firestore Index Error Investigation**: Identified complex query issue
  - Located problematic query in `InventoryService.getAvailableMedicines()`
  - Multiple inequality filters causing index requirement
  - Applied client-side filtering solution attempt

### ✅ **Issue Resolved:**
- ✅ **Firestore Index Error**: Fixed in Available Medicines screen
  - Error: `[cloud_firestore/failed-precondition] The query requires an index`
  - Location: `InventoryService.getAvailableMedicines()` method
  - **Fix Applied**: Removed `orderBy` clauses from both `getAvailableMedicines()` and `getMyInventory()` methods
  - **Solution**: Moved sorting to client-side using `items.sort((a, b) => b.createdAt.compareTo(a.createdAt))`
  - **Status**: Resolved - queries now use only equality filters which don't require custom indexes

### 📋 **Files Modified:**
- `pharmacy_app/lib/screens/inventory/create_custom_medicine_screen.dart` - New custom medicine creation screen
- `pharmacy_app/lib/screens/inventory/add_medicine_screen.dart` - Added "Create New" button integration
- `pharmacy_app/lib/services/inventory_service.dart` - Fixed Firestore index error by removing orderBy clauses
- `firestore.rules` - Updated to allow medicines collection operations

## 🛠️ Current Session Work (2025-09-01)

### ✅ **Major Issues Resolved:**
- ✅ **Firestore Index Error**: Permanently fixed
  - **Problem**: `[cloud_firestore/failed-precondition] The query requires an index` in Available Medicines screen
  - **Root Cause**: Using `orderBy` with equality filters required composite indexes
  - **Solution**: Removed server-side orderBy, implemented client-side sorting with `items.sort((a, b) => b.createdAt.compareTo(a.createdAt))`
  - **Impact**: All inventory queries now work without custom Firestore indexes

- ✅ **User Confusion About Empty Database**: Clarified and Enhanced
  - **Issue**: User expected pre-populated African medicines database
  - **Clarification**: 8 African medicines exist in static list, empty UI is normal for fresh database
  - **Enhancement**: Added FloatingActionButton for easier medicine addition
  - **Workflow**: Explained complete inventory → proposal → exchange flow

### ✅ **UI/UX Improvements:**
- ✅ **Quick Action Buttons**: Reduced to 1/4 size for web version
  - Changed grid from `crossAxisCount: 2` to `4` (4 columns)
  - Reduced icon size from `36px` to `20px`
  - Reduced text size from `14px` to `11px`
  - Reduced padding from `16px` to `8px`
  - Added `childAspectRatio: 1.2` for compact layout

- ✅ **Inventory Management**: Enhanced accessibility
  - Added FloatingActionButton in InventoryBrowserScreen when in "My Inventory" mode
  - Only shows when `showMyInventory = true`
  - Provides quick access to AddMedicineScreen

### 🔄 **Architecture Investigation:**
- ✅ **Medicine Database Strategy**: Defined expansion approach
  - **Current**: 8 essential African medicines (WHO-based)
  - **Proposed**: Research-based expansion to 100+ medicines from official African sources
  - **Method**: Curated quarterly updates rather than real-time user contributions
  - **Sources**: WHO, Kenya Essential List, Nigeria Formulary, Ghana Guidelines

### 📋 **Files Modified:**
- `pharmacy_app/lib/services/inventory_service.dart` - Fixed Firestore index by removing orderBy clauses
- `pharmacy_app/lib/screens/main/dashboard_screen.dart` - Reduced quick action button sizes for web
- `pharmacy_app/lib/screens/inventory/inventory_browser_screen.dart` - Added FloatingActionButton for medicine addition
