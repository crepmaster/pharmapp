# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## üö® **CRITICAL: BEFORE MODIFYING REGISTRATION/AUTH CODE**

**‚ö†Ô∏è READ THIS FIRST:** [`docs/FILE_STRUCTURE_ACTIVE_VS_OBSOLETE.md`](docs/FILE_STRUCTURE_ACTIVE_VS_OBSOLETE.md)

**We have lost multiple days modifying obsolete/unused files!**

Before making ANY changes to registration screens, authentication flows, or login screens:
1. **CHECK** the file structure document above
2. **VERIFY** the file is marked as ACTIVE (not obsolete)
3. **CONFIRM** via git logs and console output

**Key Active Files:**
- Registration Flow: `pharmacy_app/lib/screens/auth/register_screen.dart`
- Navigation Helper: `pharmacy_app/lib/services/registration_navigation_helper.dart`
- Auth Service: `shared/lib/services/unified_auth_service.dart`

**DO NOT modify files without checking the documentation first!**

## Project Overview

This repository contains a Flutter-based medicine exchange platform with three applications that connect to a Firebase backend system:

- **pharmacy_app/**: Mobile app for pharmacies to manage inventory and exchange medicines
- **courier_app/**: Mobile app for couriers handling deliveries between pharmacies
- **admin_panel/**: Web-based admin control panel for subscription and pharmacy management
- **shared/**: Shared code and utilities including encrypted payment preferences system

All apps are built with Flutter 3.13+ and use Firebase as the backend service.

### Backend Integration

The mobile apps connect to a Firebase backend system (separate repository at D:\Projects\pharmapp) that provides:
- **Payment Processing**: Mobile money integration (MTN MoMo, Orange Money)
- **Exchange Management**: Peer-to-peer pharmaceutical exchanges with escrow functionality
- **Wallet System**: User balance management with hold/release mechanisms
- **Firebase Functions**: Cloud functions for payment webhooks, exchange workflows, and scheduled tasks
- **Firebase Project ID**: `mediexchange`

## Development Commands

### Building and Running

## üß™ **TESTING PHASE WORKFLOW**

**CRITICAL SECURITY RULE: Real API keys are TEMPORARY for testing only!**

### Testing Phase Procedure:

#### üîì **START Testing Phase**
1. **Get Firebase Keys** (automated via Firebase CLI):
   ```bash
   # Get real API keys from Firebase project
   firebase apps:sdkconfig web --project=mediexchange
   ```
   Copy the `apiKey` and `appId` values from the output.

2. **Temporarily Add Real Keys**:
   Edit `pharmacy_app/lib/firebase_options.dart` lines 28 & 30:
   ```dart
   // TESTING PHASE: Replace placeholders with real keys (from firebase CLI)
   defaultValue: 'AIzaSyDrM96tzLwGkVaCvqEP9cWAXZYqvOEGyAs',      // ‚Üê Real key here
   defaultValue: '1:850077575356:web:67c7130629f17dd57708b9',   // ‚Üê Real app ID here
   ```

3. **Deploy CORS-enabled Functions** (if needed):
   ```bash
   cd functions && npm run build
   cd functions && firebase deploy --only functions:topupIntent
   ```

4. **Run Applications**:
   ```bash
   cd pharmacy_app && flutter run -d chrome --web-port=8084
   cd courier_app && flutter run -d chrome --web-port=8085  
   cd admin_panel && flutter run -d chrome --web-port=8086
   ```

#### üîí **END Testing Phase (MANDATORY)**
**BEFORE ANY GIT COMMIT**: Restore placeholders in `firebase_options.dart`:
```dart
// SECURE: Restore placeholders before committing
defaultValue: 'AIzaSyC-PLACEHOLDER-REPLACE-WITH-REAL-KEY'
defaultValue: '1:850077575356:web:PLACEHOLDER-REPLACE-WITH-REAL-APPID'
```

**This ensures real Firebase keys are NEVER committed to git history!**

**üîë Test Accounts (Real Firebase Data):**
```
Email: meunier@promoshake.net
Password: [use your actual password from registration]
Pharmacy: Test Pharmacy with encrypted payment preferences (from 2025-09-08)

Email: 09092025@promoshake.net
Password: [your new password]
Pharmacy: New test pharmacy (created 2025-09-09)
```

**üì± Test Mobile Money Numbers:**
- MTN: 677123456, 678123456
- Orange: 694123456, 695123456

## üí∞ **WALLET TESTING PROCEDURES**

### **Frontend Wallet Testing Steps**:

1. **Login to Test Account**:
   - Use: `09092025@promoshake.net` (has 25,000 XAF pre-credited)
   - Navigate to: http://localhost:8084
   
2. **Check Initial Balance**:
   - Dashboard should display current wallet balance
   - Should show: 25,000 XAF from previous sandboxCredit operations

3. **Test Wallet Top-up (Frontend)**:
   - Click "Add Money" or "Top-up Wallet" button
   - Select payment method (MTN/Orange)
   - Enter amount (e.g., 10,000 XAF)
   - Enter test mobile number
   - **Known Issue**: CORS error may occur with `topupIntent` function
   
4. **Alternative: Direct API Testing**:
   ```bash
   # Test sandboxCredit function directly (working alternative)
   curl -X POST https://europe-west1-mediexchange.cloudfunctions.net/sandboxCredit \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "email": "09092025@promoshake.net",
       "amount": 10000,
       "currency": "XAF"
     }'
   ```

5. **CORS Troubleshooting** (if topupIntent fails):
   ```bash
   # Verify CORS is enabled on topupIntent
   curl -i -X OPTIONS https://europe-west1-mediexchange.cloudfunctions.net/topupIntent \
     -H "Origin: http://localhost:8084" \
     -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: POST"
   
   # Should return: access-control-allow-origin: http://localhost:8084
   ```

6. **Backend Wallet Verification**:
   ```bash
   # Check wallet balance via backend
   cd functions && pwsh ./scripts/test-cloudrun.ps1 -GetWallet 09092025@promoshake.net
   ```

### **Expected Test Results**:
- ‚úÖ Wallet balance displays correctly in frontend
- ‚úÖ sandboxCredit function works (CORS enabled)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  topupIntent may have CORS issues (requires deployment fix)
- ‚úÖ Backend wallet queries work via PowerShell script

**Building APKs:**
```bash
# Build APK for pharmacy app
cd pharmacy_app && flutter build apk

# Build APK for courier app
cd courier_app && flutter build apk

# Build web app for admin panel
cd admin_panel && flutter build web
```

### Testing and Analysis
```bash
# Run tests for pharmacy app
cd pharmacy_app && flutter test

# Run tests for courier app
cd courier_app && flutter test

# Analyze code for issues
cd pharmacy_app && flutter analyze
cd courier_app && flutter analyze

# Format code
cd pharmacy_app && dart format .
cd courier_app && dart format .
```
