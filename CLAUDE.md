## Code Review - 2025-09-04

### ⚠️ Issues Critiques
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Compilation Error in Admin Panel** - `admin_panel/lib/services/admin_auth_service.dart:168` has malformed import statement causing build failure. Fix: Move `import 'dart:math' as math;` to top of file.
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Production Debug Statements** - Found 200+ `print()` statements across all apps that will expose sensitive data in production logs. Remove all debug prints before deployment.
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Unsafe BuildContext Usage** - 15+ instances of `BuildContext` used across async gaps without proper mounted checks, causing potential crashes. Example: `exchange_status_screen.dart:335`, `qr_scanner_screen.dart:391`.
- [ ] **SECURITY: Predictable Error Messages** - Authentication services leak user existence through different error messages (user-not-found vs wrong-password). Standardize to generic "Invalid credentials" message.
- [ ] **PERFORMANCE: Missing Error Handling** - Many async operations lack comprehensive try-catch blocks, risking app crashes. Files: `delivery_service.dart`, `inventory_service.dart`.
- [ ] **DEPENDENCY: Missing Package Declaration** - `courier_app/lib/screens/deliveries/delivery_camera_screen.dart:5` imports `path` package without declaring it in `pubspec.yaml`.

### 🟡 Améliorations Importantes  
- [ ] **Test Coverage Insufficient** - Only basic smoke tests exist. Implement unit tests for critical services: `PaymentService`, `InventoryService`, `SubscriptionService`.
- [ ] **Code Duplication** - Identical `AuthTextField` and `AuthButton` widgets duplicated across pharmacy_app and courier_app. Move to shared package.
- [ ] **Unused Dependencies** - Several unused imports and fields detected by Flutter analyzer (54 issues in courier_app, 100 in pharmacy_app). Clean up to reduce bundle size.
- [ ] **Deprecated API Usage** - 20+ instances of deprecated `withOpacity()` calls should be replaced with `withValues()` to avoid precision loss.
- [ ] **Missing Loading States** - Many screens lack proper loading indicators during async operations, creating poor UX during network delays.
- [ ] **Firestore Query Optimization** - Client-side sorting implemented but could be optimized with proper indexing strategy for production scale.

### 💡 Suggestions
- [ ] **Performance Monitoring** - Implement Firebase Performance Monitoring to track real-world app performance and identify bottlenecks.
- [ ] **Offline Capability** - Add local caching with `sqflite` for critical data to support intermittent connectivity common in African regions.
- [ ] **Internationalization** - Prepare i18n framework for planned Swahili and French localization support.
- [ ] **Analytics Integration** - Add Firebase Analytics to track user engagement and business metrics for data-driven improvements.
- [ ] **Push Notifications** - Implement FCM for order status updates and proposal notifications to improve user engagement.
