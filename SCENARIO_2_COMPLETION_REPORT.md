### Critical Fix Applied During Testing

**Issue Encountered**:
- Initial registration attempts failed with: `[cloud_firestore/permission-denied]`
- Error message: "The caller does not have permission to execute the specified operation"

**Root Cause Identified**:
- Missing Firestore security rules for `users` collection
- Unified auth service writes to TWO collections (`users` and `couriers`) in a transaction
- When `users` write failed, entire transaction rolled back

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added Firestore security rules for `users` collection
- Rules allow authenticated users to create/read/update their own documents
- Rules deployed to production Firebase

**Result**:
- ✅ Registration now succeeds
- ✅ All data saved to Firestore correctly
- ✅ Login works after registration

## 📊 Comparison: Scenario I vs Scenario II

### Scenario I: Pharmacy Registration
- **Status**: ✅ PASSED (previous session)
- **Collections Used**: `users`, `pharmacies`
- **Issues**: None (worked first time)

### Scenario II: Courier Registration
- **Status**: ✅ PASSED (this session)
- **Collections Used**: `users`, `couriers`
- **Issues Fixed**: Missing `users` collection Firestore rules

### Key Finding
Both scenarios use the **same unified authentication code**, confirming:
- ✅ Unified auth system works correctly for both user types
- ✅ Code is properly shared via `pharmapp_unified` package
- ✅ Firestore rules now properly configured for all collections

## 🔧 Code Changes Made

### 1. Added Debug Logging
**File**: `shared/lib/services/unified_auth_service.dart`
- Added try-catch around Firestore transaction
- Added debug logs for transaction success/failure
- Added debug logs showing data keys and values

### 2. Enhanced Data Validation
**File**: `pharmapp_unified/lib/screens/auth/unified_registration_screen.dart`
- Added `fullName` field to courier profile data
- Ensures all required fields are present for Firestore validation

### 3. Fixed Firestore Security Rules
**Platform**: Firebase Console → Firestore Rules
- Added `users` collection security rules
- Allows authenticated users to create their own documents
- Prevents unauthorized access and deletion
