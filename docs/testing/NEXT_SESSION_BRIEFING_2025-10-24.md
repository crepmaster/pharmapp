# 📋 NEXT SESSION BRIEFING - 2025-10-24

## ✅ TODAY'S COMPLETED WORK (2025-10-23)

### **1. Wallet Balance Auto-Refresh - COMPLETED ✅**
**Problem**: After mobile money top-up, wallet balance wasn't updating on frontend.

**Root Cause**: Mobile money payments are asynchronous (webhook processes payment later, not immediately).

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added intelligent polling mechanism (checks balance every 3 seconds for 60 seconds)
- Visual feedback: Blue progress indicator "Waiting for payment confirmation... (up to 60s)"
- Memory-safe: Proper timer cleanup, race condition prevention
- **Code Review Score**: 8.0/10 - Production Ready
- **Commit**: `cffb8fc` - "🔧 FIX: Wallet balance auto-refresh with async payment polling"

**Files Changed**:
- `pharmacy_app/lib/screens/main/dashboard_screen.dart` (polling mechanism)

---

### **2. Unified App Registration Fixes - COMPLETED ✅**

#### **Issue #1: Placeholder Dashboard Problem**
**User Report**: "Login is working, but when we are arriving from the unified app it is not working"

**Problem**:
- Registration succeeded in Firestore
- But showed placeholder screen: "Pharmacy screens will be migrated here"
- Users confused, thought registration failed

**Solution**:
- Updated `PharmacyMainScreen` to show success message
- Clear instructions to use dedicated pharmacy app at http://localhost:8084
- **Commit**: `ff5b968` - "🔧 FIX: Unified app registration - Add GPS coords + Redirect to pharmacy app"

#### **Issue #2: Missing GPS Coordinates**
**User Report**: "Why does the pharmacy localisation lost gps coordinate (the free api we were using)"

**Problem**:
- Unified registration collected address but NO latitude/longitude
- Missing required fields for location-based features

**Solution**:
- Added `latitude: 0.0` and `longitude: 0.0` fields to pharmacy profile
- Added TODO for proper geocoding API (Nominatim/OpenStreetMap)
- **Commit**: `ff5b968`

**Files Changed**:
- `pharmapp_unified/lib/screens/auth/unified_registration_screen.dart` (added GPS fields)
- `pharmapp_unified/lib/screens/pharmacy/pharmacy_main_screen.dart` (success screen)

## 🏗️ NEXT MAJOR FEATURE: City-Based Exchange/Sell Architecture

### **User Requirements**:
> "if the registration process works from both (unified landing and pharmacy or courier app) we will test the top up and start dealing with the architecture of the exchange/sell since we need to **regroup pharmacies and courier by cities** and the **notification needs to be sent to only the pharmacies of the same cities**"

### **Key Requirements Identified**:

1. **City-Based Grouping**:
   - Pharmacies grouped by city
   - Couriers grouped by operating city
   - Exchanges/sells only visible within same city

2. **Notification System**:
   - When pharmacy posts exchange/sell request
   - Notify ONLY pharmacies in the same city
   - Notify ONLY couriers operating in that city

3. **Data Architecture Needs**:
   ```
   Exchange Request:
   ├── originPharmacyId
   ├── city (required)
   ├── status
   └── createdAt

   Pharmacy:
   ├── city (already exists)
   ├── latitude (now included)
   └── longitude (now included)

   Courier:
   ├── operatingCity (already exists)
   └── availableCities (for multi-city couriers?)
   ```

4. **Firestore Query Strategy**:
   ```dart
   // Get pharmacies in same city
   FirebaseFirestore.instance
     .collection('pharmacies')
     .where('city', isEqualTo: userCity)
     .where('isActive', isEqualTo: true)
     .get();

   // Get couriers in same city
   FirebaseFirestore.instance
     .collection('couriers')
     .where('operatingCity', isEqualTo: userCity)
     .where('isActive', isEqualTo: true)
     .get();
   ```

5. **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) Strategy**:
   - Topic-based messaging: `/topics/city_{cityName}`
   - Each pharmacy/courier subscribes to their city topic on login
   - Exchange requests trigger topic notifications

## 🔧 KNOWN ISSUES / TODO

### **High Priority**:
1. ⚠️ **GPS Geocoding**: Currently using placeholder (0.0, 0.0)
   - Need to implement Nominatim or similar free geocoding API
   - Convert address to real latitude/longitude
   - File: `pharmapp_unified/lib/screens/auth/unified_registration_screen.dart:800`

### **Medium Priority**:
2. 🔧 **Wallet Polling Enhancement** (from code review):
   - Add success notification when balance increases
   - Add error handling for network failures
   - Add lifecycle observer to pause polling when app backgrounded

### **Future Enhancements**:
3. 💡 **URL Launcher**: Auto-open pharmacy app after unified registration
4. 💡 **City Auto-Detection**: Use GPS to auto-select city during registration

---

## 📊 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN: City-Based Exchange Architecture

### **Phase 1: Data Model Updates**
1. Ensure all exchanges have `city` field
2. Add city validation during exchange creation
3. Update Firestore indexes for city-based queries

### **Phase 2: Query Modifications**
1. Update exchange listing to filter by city
2. Update courier delivery listing to filter by city
3. Add city-based pagination

### **Phase 3: Notification System**
