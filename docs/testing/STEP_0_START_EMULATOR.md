# üéØ STEP 0: START THE EMULATOR (DO THIS FIRST!)

**‚ö†Ô∏è THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP - DO NOT SKIP!**

---

## Why You MUST Start Emulator First

**Without the emulator running**:
- ‚ùå `flutter run -d emulator-5554` will fail
- ‚ùå You'll see "No supported devices found"
- ‚ùå Cannot test pharmacy_app or courier_app

**With the emulator running**:
- ‚úÖ Apps launch successfully
- ‚úÖ Can perform registration tests
- ‚úÖ Data saves to Firebase

---

## üöÄ How to Start the Emulator

### Option 1: Command Line (Fast)

**Open PowerShell or Terminal**:

```bash
# Start Pixel 9a emulator
emulator -avd Pixel_9a
```

**Expected output**:
```
INFO    | Android emulator version 36.2.12.0
INFO    | Found systemPath...
INFO    | Starting emulator...
```

**Wait 1-2 minutes** - Emulator window will appear and Android will boot

---

### Option 2: Android Studio (Easier for beginners)

1. **Open Android Studio**
2. **Click Device Manager** icon (üì± in toolbar on right)
3. **Find "Pixel 9a"** in the list
4. **Click ‚ñ∂Ô∏è (Play button)** next to Pixel 9a
5. **Wait for emulator window** to open
6. **Wait for Android to boot** (lock screen or home screen appears)

---

## ‚úÖ How to Verify Emulator is Ready

### Method 1: Check with ADB

```bash
adb devices
```

**‚úÖ READY - Expected output**:
```
List of devices attached
emulator-5554   device
```

**‚ùå NOT READY - Still booting**:
```
List of devices attached
emulator-5554   offline
```
Wait 30 more seconds and check again.

**‚ùå NOT RUNNING**:
```
List of devices attached
```
No devices listed ‚Üí Go back and start emulator!

---

### Method 2: Visual Confirmation

**Look at the emulator window**:
- ‚úÖ **READY**: Shows Android lock screen or home screen
- ‚ùå **NOT READY**: Shows "Android" logo with animation
- ‚ùå **NOT RUNNING**: No emulator window visible

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Timeline

| Activity | Duration |
|----------|----------|
| Start emulator command | Instant |
| Emulator window appears | 10-20 seconds |
| Android boots | 1-2 minutes |
| **Total to ready** | **1-2 minutes** |

**First boot**: May take 2-3 minutes
**Subsequent boots**: Usually 1-2 minutes

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: "emulator: command not found"

**Fix**: Add Android SDK to PATH

**Windows**:
```bash
# Typical Android SDK location:
C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\emulator

# Add to PATH environment variable
```

**Alternative**: Use full path:
```bash
C:\Users\aebon\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\emulator\emulator.exe -avd Pixel_9a
```

---

### Issue: Emulator starts but shows "offline"

**Wait**: Give it 30-60 more seconds

**If still offline after 2 minutes**:
```bash
# Restart ADB
adb kill-server
adb start-server
adb devices
```

---

### Issue: Emulator is very slow

**Check Hardware Acceleration**:
- Android Studio ‚Üí Tools ‚Üí AVD Manager
- Click ‚úèÔ∏è (Edit) on Pixel 9a
- Show Advanced Settings
- Graphics: Should be "Hardware - GLES 2.0" or "Hardware"
- CPU/RAM: Give it 2GB+ RAM

**Your System**:
- ‚úÖ GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 (Good!)
- ‚úÖ Acceleration: WHPX (Windows Hypervisor Platform) - Working

---

### Issue: Emulator won't start at all

**Check available emulators**:
```bash
emulator -list-avds
```

**Expected**:
```
Pixel_9a
Medium_Phone_API_36.1
Medium_Tablet
Small_Phone
```

**If Pixel_9a is not in the list**:
- Create it in Android Studio ‚Üí Device Manager
- Or use another emulator: `emulator -avd Medium_Phone_API_36.1`
