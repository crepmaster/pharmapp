# PharmApp Unified - Master Application

**🚀 MASTER APPLICATION - This is the primary and only active PharmApp project**

PharmApp Unified is a comprehensive Flutter-based medicine exchange platform that combines both **Pharmacy** and **Courier** functionality into a single unified application.

## 📱 What is PharmApp Unified?

PharmApp Unified is a mobile application that enables:
- **Pharmacies**: Manage inventory, create medicine exchange proposals, track subscriptions, and manage profiles
- **Couriers**: Accept delivery orders, track GPS routes, scan QR codes, and manage wallet withdrawals
- **Unified Authentication**: Role-based authentication system with secure wallet integration
- **Payment Integration**: Mobile money (MTN MoMo, Orange Money) with encrypted payment preferences
- **City-Based Operations**: Geographic isolation for exchanges and deliveries
